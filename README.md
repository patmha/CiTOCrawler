# CiTOCrawler

A configurable crawler that looks for embedded RDF (specifically RDF statements using the [CiTO](http://www.sparontologies.net/ontologies/cito) ontology) and stores the resulting graphs with provenance information in the style of the [OpenCitations](http://opencitations.net/) project.

Developed in Python using the Scrapy framework.
